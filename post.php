                Confirmation bias is a well-documented psychological phenomenon that refers to the 
                tendency of individuals to seek, interpret, and remember information in a way 
                that confirms their preexisting beliefs or hypotheses while ignoring or discounting 
                information that contradicts those beliefs. In other words, people tend to favor 
                and pay more attention to information that supports what they already believe and 
                dismiss or downplay information that challenges their beliefs.
